# 03tailwindprops Project Structure

This project was created using Tailwind CSS and React.

## Directory Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── (Component files)
├── App.css
├── App.jsx
├── index.css
├── main.jsx
```

`React does not allow direct access to files inside src/assets using a regular string path`

## Files

### App.css

This file contains the global CSS styles for the application.

### App.jsx

This is the main React component file. It imports other components and sets up the application's routing.

### index.css

This file contains the global CSS styles for the application.

### main.jsx

This file is the entry point of the application. It renders the `App` component into the DOM.

## Adding a New Component

To add a new component to the project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in the `src/components/` directory with a descriptive name (e.g., `NewComponent.jsx`).
2. In the new file, import React and any necessary dependencies.
3. Define the new component as a function or a class component.
4. Export the new component using the `export default` statement.
5. Import the new component in the file where you want to use it (e.g., `App.jsx`).
6. Use the new component in the desired location within the parent component.
